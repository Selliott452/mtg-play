/**
 * The match-protocol schema version (ADR-008), carried in every [ServerMessage]/[ClientMessage]
 * envelope so a peer can reject a mismatch loudly rather than silently misreading the wire format.
 *
 * The schema is same-repo with the engine (ADR-008 amendment): a new `DecisionRequest` kind is a
 * compile-time break of the exhaustive DTO mapping, so schema versions track engine versions. Bump
 * this whenever the wire shape changes in a way a peer must know about.
