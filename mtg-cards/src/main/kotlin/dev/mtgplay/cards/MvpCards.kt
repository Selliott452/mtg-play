/**
 * The registry of every card `mtg-cards` defines so far. The P2.2 pool: the basic lands
 * [mountain], [forest], and [plains], and [lightningBolt]; the gauntlet Tranche 0 packet completes
 * the five basics with [island] and [swamp]. The P3.2 pool adds the first real
 * creatures (CR 302): [grizzlyBears], [hillGiant], [windDrake], [youthfulKnight], and
 * [standingTroops]. The P4.2 pool adds the seven real Bogles continuous-effect Auras (CR 303):
 * [rancor], [armadilloCloak], [cartoucheOfSolidarity], [sentinelsEyes], [etherealArmor],
 * [ancestralMask], and [abundantGrowth] — each encoded to its P4 static half (docs/design/layer-system.md).
 * The P5.3 pool adds the three real Bogles hexproof one-drops (CR 702.11): [gladecoverScout],
 * [slipperyBogle] (the first hybrid-cost card), and [silhanaLedgewalker] (with its blockable-only-by-flying
 * evasion). The P6.2b pool completes both MVP decklists: the Mono-Red Madness thirteen — [guttersnipe],
 * [sneakySnacker], [voldarenEpicure], [fieryTemper], [fireblast], [lavaDart], [grabThePrize],
 * [faithlessLooting], [meldedMoxite], and [highwayRobbery] (MadnessDeck.kt) — plus the remaining GW-Bogles
 * utility cards [utopiaSprawl], [malevolentRumble], and [ashBarrens] (BoglesUtility.kt). Their predefined
 * tokens ([bloodToken], [robotToken], [eldraziSpawnToken]) are created on demand and registered by the
 * create-token primitive, so — like [warriorToken] — they are not top-level registry entries.
 *
 * [definitions] is shaped for direct `MatchConfig.definitions` consumption: the engine carries
 * it into `GameState` in canonical name-sorted order regardless of this map's own order
 * (ADR-009 — definitions ride in the state; a [CardRef] without an entry is inert). The pool
 * grows card by card through Phase 6; each addition is a definition file plus one entry here.
